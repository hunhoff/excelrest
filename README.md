# excelrest
The EXCELREST aims to be a scriptable RESTful  client that uses re- usable test cases  written on a excel  spreadsheet making  easier to maintain,  create new test cases,  avoiding re-work and  making web services  testing straightforward, extensible and  effective. The tool  itself is platform  independent and can be  used to test other  services and projects  that feature RESTful web interfaces. EXCELREST is a tool based on Java that will send requests using different HTTP  methods to test the REST API service. Using the  EXCELREST, the team can  manipulate the URL,  request method, body and header content.
